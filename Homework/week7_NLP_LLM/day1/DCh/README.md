In this example, thanks to you, it was clearly visible how the evolution of thought (i.e., the evolution of models) allows for the implementation of more complex embeddings. These, in turn, enable the creation and evaluation of context. Thus, through NER, we obtained a multitude of words that were reflected in BoW, but with the use of TF-IDF and an increased number of features, it becomes possible to find hidden patterns and derive results from them.
