Pipeline for the Pokemon Win Prediction Analysis task

Import libraries and load data
Import libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
Load the files pokemon.csv and combats.csv into DataFrames.

Preliminary data inspection
View the first few rows of each dataset (head()).
Check structure, data types, and missing values (info(), isnull().sum()).

Handle missing values and data corrections
Fill the missing name for Pokémon #62 (Primeape).
In the column Type 2, replace missing values with the string "None".
Check for other missing values and decide how to handle them.

Merge data and create new features
Create a dictionary or DataFrame with the number of wins and total battles for each Pokémon from combats.csv.
Calculate the win percentage = (number of wins / total battles) * 100.
Add this feature to the main Pokémon DataFrame.
If needed, merge data by Pokémon ID.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
Build a correlation matrix between main stats and win percentage.
Visualize statistics vs. win percentage using seaborn.pairplot or PairGrid.
Analyze the top 10 Pokémon by win percentage — display their stats and plot graphs.

Prepare data for modeling
Select features such as HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Type 1, Type 2, Legendary, etc.
Convert categorical features to numeric (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
If necessary, scale numeric features (e.g., using StandardScaler).

Build and train machine learning models
Train several regression models to predict win percentage:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor (if available)
Tune hyperparameters if needed (e.g., basic parameters for a start).

Evaluate and compare models
Predict win percentages on the test set.
Calculate the quality metric — MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for each model.
Visualize model error comparison (e.g., bar plot).

Summary and conclusions
Make a brief summary: which features are important, which model predicts best.
Discuss possible improvements or next steps.

Finalization
Organize all code and comments in a Jupyter Notebook.
Add visualizations and brief explanations for each step.
Upload the notebook to a GitHub repository.
