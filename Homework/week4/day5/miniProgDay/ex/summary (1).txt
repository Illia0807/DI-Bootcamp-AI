📊 AAPL Stock Analysis Project — Summary

1. 📁 Initial Data Exploration
- Data was successfully loaded and cleaned of missing values.
- The 'Date' column was converted to datetime and set as the index.
- The primary interval between entries is 1 day, with some gaps of 3–4 days (likely weekends or holidays).
- The dataset spans from 1981-01-02 to 2023-10-13 (10,608 records).
- The columns Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume contain numerical float/int values.

2. 📈 Data Visualization
- Plotted the following charts:
  - Closing price (Close) over time.
  - Trading volume (Volume) over time.
  - Moving averages (MA 30 and MA 90).
  - Candlestick chart to visualize Open, High, Low, and Close prices.

3. 📉 Statistical Analysis
- Calculated key statistics (mean, median, std) for relevant columns.
- Computed moving averages:
  - MA 30: short-term trend.
  - MA 90: long-term trend.
- Visualized moving averages alongside the Close price.

4. 🧪 Hypothesis Testing
- Added a 'Daily Return' column.
- Performed a t-test comparing average Close prices between two years (e.g., 2000 vs 2020), showing statistically significant difference.
- Tested the distribution of Daily Returns:
  - Used the Shapiro-Wilk test.
  - p-value < 0.05 → the null hypothesis of normal distribution is rejected.

5. 🧠 Advanced Statistical Techniques (Bonus)
- Calculated a 30-day moving average using NumPy’s `np.convolve`.
- Analyzed correlation:
  - Between MA_30 and Volume: moderate negative correlation.
  - Between Close and Volume by year: fluctuations depending on market activity.
- Visualized return distribution using Seaborn.

📌 Overall Conclusions:
- AAPL stock prices show long-term growth with temporary declines.
- Trading volume has increased significantly over the years, especially after the 2000s.
- Moving averages effectively illustrate both short- and long-term trends.
- Year-to-year price differences are statistically significant.
- Daily returns do not follow a normal distribution.
