✈️ Summary of Findings and Insights

📊 1. General Trends:
- The number of plane crashes began increasing in the early 20th century, peaking in the 1970s, followed by a steady decline.
- Most crashes occurred during the 1970s–1980s, coinciding with the rapid expansion of civil aviation and less advanced technology.

⚰️ 2. Fatal Outcomes:
- The distribution of fatalities is right-skewed: most crashes involved relatively few casualties, but there are several major disasters with hundreds of deaths.
- The average number of fatalities was higher in the 1970s compared to the 2000s, confirmed by a t-test (p-value < 0.05) → a statistically significant difference in lethality between the decades.

🌍 3. Crash Geography:
- Most incidents occurred in countries such as:
  - 🇺🇸 United States
  - 🇷🇺 Russia (or USSR)
  - 🇨🇳 China
  - 🇧🇷 Brazil
- This may be related to both country size and aviation traffic intensity.

🛠️ 4. Operator Type:
- Many incidents were associated with military aviation, especially in earlier decades.
- Civil aviation became dominant toward the end of the 20th century.

📅 5. Trends:
- The number of crashes has declined since the 1990s, likely due to:
  - improved flight safety,
  - implementation of advanced navigation and control technologies,
  - stronger aviation regulations.

🔍 Insights:
- The 1970s were the most dangerous decade in aviation history.
- Modern aviation is significantly safer, particularly in terms of fatal incidents.
- Major disasters are rare but have a large impact on overall statistics.
